# Scrutinization-of-Mammogram-Images-using-Deep-Learning

Progressive steps were taken by the deep learning model in a multitude of implementations, such as 
hyperspectral image processing and natural language processing. The main source of interest is the CNN 
(Convolutional neural network), which is regarded as one of the prominent potent techniques for 
discovering incentive of images and other semantic information. Datasets include images taken using a 
innumerable imaging modalities, including MRIs, CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, PET scans, fluorescein 
angiography, and even photographs. This study examines several Deep learning method design patterns 
and partially centers on the CNN, which provides an exceptional percentage of solutions when compared 
to other DNN architectures. CNN prioritizes image features and uses recognizable architectural styles. 
However, restrictions that go beyond DNN training and execution time will be discussed. Finally, a 
comparison of current software frameworks for Deep Learning Method will be presented, along with future 
research prospects. The cornerstone of this exploration is to look at approaches to develop a deep learning 
model that can accurately identify breast cancer so that late medications can be mitigated because of 
inaccurate negatives and unnecessary medications can be avoided owing to wrongful convictions. A dataset 
of 1312 photos was used, which included photographs of both benign and malignant kinds. The models 
ResNet50, DenseNet201, AlexNet, and VGG16 are used. Without any transfer learning, we attain the best 
accuracy for our basic model. Augmentation is a technique for rescaling data and reducing overfitting. 
When validated on a well-known globally available dataset, the suggested technique yields good results. 
Pre-trained models are also helpful in medical image analysis, as they execute exactly with a low loss 
function.
