## üìÑ Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical for effective treatment and minimizing unnecessary procedures.  

This project applies **deep learning models** to **classify breast ultrasound images** as benign or malignant. The work is based on the **BUSI Dataset** and has been published as a **book chapter** in:

### üìñ Abstract
Progressive steps were taken by deep learning models, with the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** as the primary method for extracting semantic information from images.  
The study explored multiple imaging modalities including MRIs, CT and PET scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, fluorescein angiography, and photographs.  
The dataset contained **13120 images** of benign and malignant cases. Models implemented include **AlexNet, ResNet50, DenseNet201, and VGG16**, as well as a **Base CNN model with data augmentation**, which achieved the best accuracy.  
This work demonstrates how deep learning can **accurately detect breast cancer**, helping reduce false negatives and unnecessary treatments.
